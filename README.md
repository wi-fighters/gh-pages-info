# HTML exercise

Take a look at screenshot.png

Your task is to recreate the structure of this page using semantic HTML.

In starter.txt you'll find the starter text and links, but the HTML is up to you!

Practice using [multi-cursor selection](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_multi-cursor-selection) to edit repetitive parts of your code.

## Checklist

- write your code in a file called index.html

- [proper indentation](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html) (start here and it'll make the rest much easier)

- [a valid HTML5 doctype declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype)

- all the essential nodes (and feel free to add some extras)

- check your syntax (especially nested lists) on MDN's [HTML text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals) page (this whole page is an excellent read)

Please push your changes when you're done.
